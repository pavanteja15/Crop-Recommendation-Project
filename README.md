# Crop-Recommendation-Project

The Smart Crop Recommendation System project aims to utilize artificial intelligence and
advanced ensemble machine learning techniques to assist farmers in choosing the most suitable
crops for cultivation, based on real-time soil health and environmental parameters. This intelligent
system utilizes a combination of models, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and a Meta
Learner based on Logistic Regression, to provide highly accurate crop recommendations tailored
to specific agricultural inputs. The foundation of this system lies in a comprehensive dataset that
includes key agronomic parameters such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K),
temperature, humidity, pH level, and rainfall. These features are critically important for
determining soil fertility and climatic suitability, both of which directly influence crop
productivity. To ensure effective model performance, several preprocessing steps are applied,
including data cleaning, label encoding, normalization, and an 80:20 train-test split, allowing the
models to learn meaningful patterns from the data. One of the systemâ€™s core strengths is its use of
ensemble learning. By combining multiple weak learners, it significantly reduces overfitting and
increases generalization accuracy.
